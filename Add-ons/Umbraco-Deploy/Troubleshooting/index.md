# Troubleshooting

In this troubleshooting section, you can find help to resolve issues that you might run into when using Umbraco Deploy.

If you are unable to find the issue you are having, then please reach out to our friendly support team at contact@umbraco.com.

## Schema mismatches

When transferring or restoring content between two Umbraco Deploy environments, you might run into **Schema mismatch** errors. For more information on how to resolve schema mismatch issues, see the [Schema Mismatches](../../../Umbraco-Cloud/Troubleshooting/Deployments/Schema-Mismatches/index.md) article.

Umbraco Deploy maintains a cached set of signatures that represent each schema and content item. They are used when transferring or restoring content between environments to aid performance.

If having resolved schema mismatches you still have reports of errors, it might be that the signatures are out of date.  In other words, Deploy is using a cached representation of an item that no longer matches the actual item stored in Umbraco.

This should not be necessary in normal use, but can occur after upgrades. If you have this situation, you can clear the cached signatures in both the upstream and downstream environments.  You do this via the *Clear Cached Signatures* operation available on the _Settings > Deploy_ dashboard:

## Slow responses or timeouts when restoring or transferring

When transferring or restoring content between environments, Deploy needs to ensure that all related items are updated together.  It also checks that any schema dependencies an item has also exist in the target environment. When a large amount of content is selected for transfer or restore, this process of determining all the dependent items can take some time.

If you find the process slow or timing out, there are few options you can take.

Firstly, you can review and update the [timeout settings available with Deploy](../Deploy-Settings/index.md#timeout-settings). Increasing these from the default values may help, but won't necessarily resolve all issues, as some timeouts are fixed values set by the hosting environment.

If transferring items from a downstream environment to an upstream one, it's possible to [configure a batch size](../Deploy-Settings/index.md#batch-settings).  With this in place, transfers will be batched into separate operations, allowing each single operation to complete before any hosting environment enforced timeout.

Finally, it's worth ensuring Deploy's cached signatures are fully populated in both the upstream and downstream environments.  This can be done via the *Set Cached Signatures* operation available on the _Settings > Deploy_ dashboard:

![Set cached signatures](images/set-cached-sigs.png)

With this carried out, the intial checks Deploy has to do to figure out the items to restore and all their dependencies will be much faster.

## Schema files following upgrades

When Umbraco schema items are created, a representation of them is saved to disk as a `.uda` file in the `/data/revision/` folder.  The representation is known as an artifact. It will be refreshed on further updates to represent the current state of the schema item.

Following an Umbraco Deploy upgrade, it's possible that the current contents of the file will no longer match what would be generated by the current version.  For example, if a property has been added to an artifact, this will be absent in the file but would be added if the file was recreated following the upgrade.

This can lead to a situation where Deploy continues to process a file it considers as changed, even though the schema item it represents is already up to date. Which in turn means slow updates of Umbraco schema, as Deploy is processing more files than it needs to do.

To resolve this situation, following an upgrade it is good practice to resave the `.uda` files in the "left-most" environment.  This will usually be the local one, or if not using that, the Development environment.  You can do this via the *Export Schema To Data Files* operation available on the _Settings > Deploy_ dashboard:

![Export schema](images/export-schema.png)

The updated files should be committed to source control and deployed to upstreamm environments.
