{% hint style="info" %}
This section about the Models Builder is valid for Umbraco 9.0+.

The full version of the Models Builder has not been migrated to Umbraco 9 yet, but when it's migrated it will be available on the [ModelsBuilder GitHub repository](https://github.com/zpqrtbnk/Zbu.ModelsBuilder). You can also download and find documentation for the full V8 version there.

Use the version-box to the right, if you need to find documentation for a different version of Umbraco.
{% endhint %}

The Models builder is a tool that can generate a complete set of strongly-typed published content models for Umbraco. Models are available in both controllers and views.
