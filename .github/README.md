## Reading & using the docs

This is the End Of Life (EOL) documentation for Umbraco. In this branch, you can find the documentation for the Umbraco versions that have gone out of support. These versions are no longer supported with patches and security fixes and are therefore not recommended. Instead, we recommend upgrading to a [supported version of Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/products/knowledge-center/long-term-support-and-end-of-life/).
